Suncoast Developers Guild strives to offer the best experience we can to prepare you for a career in professional software development. You may bring any grievances verbally or in writing (via chat or email) to an instructor who will attempt to work with you to find a solution.

If resolution is not possible with your instructor please send an email detailing the situation to our Program Director, Holly Valenty. If escalation is necessary, our CEO Jason Perry will make the final decision on any potential resolution to your issue.

Students dissatisfied with our response to their complaint, or who are not able to file acomplaint with the school can file a formal complaint with the Florida Commission forIndependent Education:
