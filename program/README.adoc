Daily Content:
  Reading and video content relating information about an idea
Lab Activity:
  ungraded, practice implementing a partially complete idea
  it should closely follow examples in the daily content
  given most of the idea, just filling in blanks
Assignment:
  graded, a small project implementing a whole idea
  it should require an abstraction of the idea presented earlier,
  as well as integrated with previously covered concepts
  usually given _some_ boilerplate
Projects:
  graded, larger multi-day (weekend) assignments that build on ideas
  presented during the week
  usually built from scratch, but
  may span building and expanding the same application over multiple weeks

Daily Content is given before every class day, it's released by the end of lunch
Lab Activities are given M-Th
Assignments are given M-W
A Project is given on Thursday

Graded work is assigned tasks over three modes:
  "Explorer" mode focuses on exploring the core concepts, as presented in the content and lectures
  "Adventure" mode focuses on diving a little deeper, into ideas not necessarily covered in class and will usually require research and investigation
  "Epic" mode focuses tying abstract ideas together and bringing professional levels of polish and effort

Career support is a mandatory part of the curriculum.
Attendance policy is unchanged.
