TODO: Toni and/or Holly expand this.

Career support services are including, but not limited to, the following:

- Curriculum including lectures, mentoring, and coaching on interview techniques, decoding technical job descriptions, resume writing workshops, and portfolio building.
- Potential employers are invited to Demo Day events that showcase the skills and work done by recent graduates.
- Guest lectures from community leaders, providing insight to topics that are related to, but outside the core program content.
- The school maintains a "reverse job board", used by local employers and hiring partners that lists graduates and alumni who are seeking employment.

Students are also encouraged to participate and attend developer dozens of community events hosted on campus and around town during their time in the program. Relationships formed at these events often lay the seeds for future employment opportunities.

IMPORTANT: While very effort is made by our team to prepare students for their first job as a junior web developer, and to connect them with employers and hiring partners through relationships our staff and faculty have built in the community, *the institution does not guarantee employment*.
