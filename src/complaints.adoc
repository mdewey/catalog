== Complaints

Suncoast Developers Guild strives to offer the best experience we can to prepare you for a career in professional software development. You may bring any grievances verbally or in writing (via chat or email) to an instructor who will attempt to work with you to find a solution.

If resolution is not possible with your instructor please send an email detailing the situation to the Program Director. If escalation is necessary, the CEO and/or President will make the final decision on any potential resolution to your issue.

Students dissatisfied with our response to their complaint, or who are not able to file a complaint with the school can file a formal complaint with the Florida Commission for Independent Education:
