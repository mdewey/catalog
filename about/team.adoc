== Jason L Perry, CEO

Jason is a native Floridian who started building for the web as a teen in the mid-'90s, so he's been a web developer for about as long as anybody. Co-founding the Tampa Ruby Brigade in 2006, Suncoast Developers Guild in 2015, Jason takes pride in being a leader in the local tech community. After stints in academia, startups, and as a consulting freelancer, he's found great joy in mentoring and sharing the knowledge gained along the way. He's also a game development enthusiast, passionate about cryptocurrency, and loves animation. Jason is a father, a skeptic, entirely too opinionated, and prefers a word count in powers of two. When the world gets heavy you can find him either unbuilding LEGOÂ® as catharsis or harnessing his power animal -- the
panda.
