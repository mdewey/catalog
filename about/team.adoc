== Jason L Perry, CEO

Jason is a native Floridian who started building for the web as a teen in the mid-'90s, so he's been a web developer for about as long as anybody. Co-founding the Tampa Ruby Brigade in 2006, Suncoast Developers Guild in 2015, Jason takes pride in being a leader in the local tech community. After stints in academia, startups, and as a consulting freelancer, he's found great joy in mentoring and sharing the knowledge gained along the way. He's also a game development enthusiast, passionate about cryptocurrency, and loves animation. Jason is a father, a skeptic, entirely too opinionated, and prefers a word count in powers of two. When the world gets heavy you can find him either unbuilding LEGO® as catharsis or harnessing his power animal -- the panda.

== Gavin Stark, CTO

Gavin is a native of Florida and currently resides in St. Petersburg. Fearful he would someday melt under the Florida sun, Gavin took a break from the Sunshine State and studied mathematics and computer science in Rochester, New York and Management Information Systems in Tucson, Arizona. Gavin has been writing software since programs were saved on tape and source code was printed in magazines. When not programming, he can be found wondering if he will ever finish book four of the _'A Song of Fire and Ice'_ series, promoting a future of electric cars, convincing his girlfriend that PopTarts™ should go in the shopping cart since they are healthy because they contain seven minerals, and recently trying his hand at improv comedy.
